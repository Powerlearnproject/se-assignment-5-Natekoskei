•	To find extensions, go to "Extensions" in the Activity Bar.
•	Search for specific extensions or browse through categories.
•	Install extensions by clicking the "Install" button and then restarting VS Code.
•	Example Essential Extensions: For web development, consider extensions like "Live Server" (live preview of code changes), "Debugger for Chrome" (debugging web apps), and "HTML Snippets" (code snippets). 


6.	Integrated Terminal:
Describe how to open and use the integrated terminal in VS Code. What are the advantages of using the integrated terminal compared to an external terminal?
•	Opening: Press Ctrl + ` to

•	Starting Debug: Set breakpoints in the code, open the Debug view (Ctrl + Shift + D), and click the "Start Debugging" button.
•	Key Features: Inspect variables, step through code, set watches, and view call stacks while debugging.

10.	Using Source Control:
    How can users integrate Git with VS Code for version control? Describe the process of initializing a repository, making commits, and pushing changes to GitHub
